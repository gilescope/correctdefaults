# Correct Defaults

## Features

This extension on startup will set settings to default values that are correct according to my definition of correct. If you disagree with any settings then override that setting - it will not stomp on any settings you have already have a view on.

Designed to be used with [RustPunk](http://github.com/gilescope/rustpunk) extension bundle.

## Known Issues
